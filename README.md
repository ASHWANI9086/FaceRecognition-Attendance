The Digital Facial Recognition Attendance System is an advanced, automated system designed to track and manage attendance efficiently using facial recognition technology 🙂🔍. Unlike traditional methods (manual registers 📝 or RFID cards 💳), this system uses computer vision 🤖 and AI 🧠 to identify individuals in real-time ⏱️, ensuring accuracy ✅, security 🔐, and time-saving management ⏳.

✨ Key Features

Facial Recognition 🙂🔍: Utilizes AI and deep learning 🧠📊 to detect and recognize faces in real-time. Each person is uniquely identified to prevent proxy attendance 🚫.

Automated Attendance Logging 🖥️✅: Marks attendance automatically, eliminating manual entry errors.

Database Integration 💾📂: Stores records securely (SQLite/MySQL) for easy retrieval, analysis 📈, and reporting.

User Management 👤⚙️: Admins can add, update, or remove users along with facial data.

Reporting & Analytics 📊🗂️: Generates daily, weekly, or monthly attendance reports and visual graphs for monitoring trends.

Security & Accuracy 🔐🎯: Works even in varied lighting 🌙💡 and with masks 😷 or glasses 🕶️.

GUI Dashboard 🖥️📋: Interactive dashboard for admins/teachers to manage attendance and view stats.

Optional Notifications ✉️📱: Can send email/SMS alerts about attendance status.
